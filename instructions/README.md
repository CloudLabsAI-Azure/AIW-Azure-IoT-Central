# Azure Virtual Workshop: IoT Central

Lab time: 90 minutes

Azure IoT Central is an IoT application platform that simplifies the creation of IoT solutions. Azure IoT Central simplifies the initial setup of your IoT solution and reduces the management burden, operational costs, and overhead of a typical IoT project. It also speeds up the time to market with industry specific templates, integration capabilities and openness. 

Choosing to build with Azure IoT Central gives an opportunity to focus your time, money, and energy on transforming your business with IoT data, rather than just building the solution from the ground up. Maintaining, and updating a complex system and continually evolving IoT infrastructure.

Azure IoT Central encompasses a range of underlying technologies that work great, but can be complicated to implement when many technologies are needed. These technologies include Azure IoT Hub, the Azure Device Provisioning System (DPS), Azure Maps, Azure Time Series Insights, Azure IoT Edge, and others. It's only necessary to use these technologies directly, if more granularity is needed than available through IoT Central.

## Lab context

In this workshop, you will learn how to deploy IoT Central Application Templates to rapidly build enterprise-grade IoT applications on a secure, reliable, and scalable infrastructure that optimize supply chains, improve experiences for customers, and track inventory more efficiently. You will see how Azure IoT Central enables the easy monitoring and management of a fleet of remote devices for logistics operations.
